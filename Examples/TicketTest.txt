Prepare the deployment for production server

Refer to the product ticket for the description of the ticket.

- [ ] Update AutoSPinstaller.xml for installation
  - [ ] Check if there need to be seperate SP Installer xmls for the Farm join since there is only one farm.
  - [x] Check if we need a separate file. Set the secret keys and replace it with Consul values into the deployment script.
- [x] Detect why the error during installation "Previously installed Office 2019" (PreReqCheck) occurred
- [x] Parameter for the Installation => For Produktiv vs Dev
  * Create a parameter to filter (blacklist) steps
  * Add a json file with default values for config params, also secrets, check if this solves #322
- [ ] Make sure the production deployment is working
- [*] Put CoScinE DB creation into its own step and otherwise throw 3.02 out
